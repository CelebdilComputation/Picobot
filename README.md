(9/10/24)
In this project I will be building a Pybot (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4579405#google_vignette).
I will be attempting to minimize costs to the project using as many components as possible from the disfunctional 3D printers in my space.
I will be printing these parts using a FlashForge Creator Pro 2 using the Flashprint slicer, Transparent and Orance PETG, and Teal PLA .
The printers I will be dismantling for this arm are an Anycubic Kossel Linear which will provide me with the required stepper motors, stepper motor cables, and motor drivers.
The other printer I wil be dismantling is a prototype printer I acquired from my former employer Re:3D, as I suspect this printer was an early prototype that led to the development of the GIGABOT I will include thorough documentation of the dissassembly and BOM.
As of this point in the project the Kossel is already dismantled and I have roughly half of the parts printed.
